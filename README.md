This repository contains all the code for the Statistical Consulting Project *Conflict Forecasting in Africa using Remote Sensing Data* at LMU Munich by Luis Fiegl and Ali Najibpour Nashi.
Due to our datasets (especially the Remote Sensing Feature Matrix) being too big, they are not contained in this repository. The files in folder *data_preparation* can be used to create all data which is used in the analysis.
