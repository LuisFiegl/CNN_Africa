For many years, conflict prediction has been a fascinating subject. To develop
early warning systems, researchers are employing statistical and mathematical methods to find conflict patterns in data. Particularly following the emergence of spatial
data from satellites (remote sensing data) and various machine learning techniques
suited to handle data of such complexity. In this project, we utilized such data to
predict violent conflicts for the entire continent of Africa. We aimed to extend pre-
vious approaches by using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Sparse Con-
volutional Neural Networks (Sparce CNNs)**, to determine whether Deep Learning
models can enhance prediction accuracy by utilizing spatial information. Thereby,
we examined the importance of remote sensing data for conflict prediction. Addi-
tionally, this project seeks to address issues that may arise in related research in
the future.


This repository contains all the code for the Statistical Consulting Project *Conflict Forecasting in Africa using Remote Sensing Data* at LMU Munich by Luis Fiegl and Ali Najibpour Nashi.

Due to our datasets (especially the Remote Sensing Feature Matrix) being too big, they are not contained in this repository. The files in folder *data_preparation* can be used to create all data which is used in the analysis.
